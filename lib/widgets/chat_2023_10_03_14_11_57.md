  }═ Exception caught by gesture ═══════════════════════════════════════════
This widget has been unmounted, so the State no longer has a context (and should be considered defunct).
2. **ChatGPT**: The error message you are encountering suggests that the context of the widget has been invalidated or destroyed, resulting in the inability to show the dialog. This typically occurs when the widget that calls `_showMessageUpdateDialog()` is unmounted or disposed of before the dialog is shown.

To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following approaches:

1. Ensure the widget calling `_showMessageUpdateDialog()` is still mounted: Check that the widget calling this function is still active and hasn't been disposed of. If necessary, try to delay the call to `_showMessageUpdateDialog()` until the widget is fully mounted.

2. Pass the context as an argument to the function: Instead of relying on the widget's context, pass the context as a parameter to `_showMessageUpdateDialog()`. This way, you can ensure that the context is still valid when showing the dialog. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:

```dart
void _showMessageUpdateDialog(BuildContext context) {
  // Rest of your code remains the same
  
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    // Rest of your code remains the same
  );
}
```

By doing this, you can call `_showMessageUpdateDialog(context)` with the correct context from the widget that is currently active.

Try implementing one of these solutions and let me know if the issue persists or if you need further assistance.
